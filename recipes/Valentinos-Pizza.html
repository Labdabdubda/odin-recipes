        <Li>1 tablespoon white sugar</Li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <Li>3 tablespoons olive oil</Li>
        <Li>1 teaspoon salt</Li>

    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir water, sugar and yeast together until dissolved. Add the olive oil and the salt. Stir in the flour
            until well blended. Let dough rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat dough into pan or on to a pizza stone using fingers dipped in olive oil. If desired sprinkle basil,
